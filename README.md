# Engineering Project Portfolio

Welcome to my collection of hardware and software projects developed through coursework and personal experimentation. This repository gathers small demos and complete applications spanning digital logic design, embedded C programming, PCB layout, ASIC development, and Python-based computer vision image processing.
